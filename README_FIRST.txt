Use the following commands to run the website:

1. npm install
2. Open index.html

NOTE:

Task 1 works.
Task 2: Storing the likes for each time period works.
By using the username dr_Rosta_Farzan anyone can reset the likes. Resetting only makes the json files on the server reset to 0 and isnt displayed on the website.
The number of likes per picture is not displayed (had some error with global variables :( )
